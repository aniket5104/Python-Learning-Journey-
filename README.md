# Python Learning Journey üêç

This repository is a collection of all my Python codes arranged **topic-wise** as I work on building a strong foundation in Python.

## üìö What's Inside
- Basic syntax and operations
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and recursion
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- File handling
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Modules and exceptions
- And more, as I keep learning...

Some files may include short notes alongside the code for quick reference.

## üöÄ Purpose
This is not a project repo ‚Äî it's a personal **learning space**, where I'm:
- Practicing what I learn
- Organizing it for revision
- **Learning in public** for consistency and growth

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
A separate repository for my **Python projects** will be uploaded soon.

## ü§ù Let's Connect
If you're also learning Python or want to collaborate, feel free to explore, share suggestions, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/aniket-ai).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repo will keep growing as I do. Stay tuned!
